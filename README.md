## Project Description:
All throughout time, the act of monitoring infants and toddlers has been a mandatory role for many parents irrespective of culture. Thus in the modern world, baby monitors were developed to aid parent supervision as they perform their daily tasks and while adjusting to parenthood. However, as these devices are costly where features are directly correlated to product cost. We introduce a device that helps parents have the ability to voice command, track/classify their infants with a low cost solution and the potential to compete with industry standard technologies. 

The NightLight infant monitor can track and record targets on it a video and audio stream during any time of the day or night. It will tell the user directly any suspicious or significant event occurring in its stream via email or text alerts. The device can also detect the sounds from the crib through ambient noises and determine the origin of the sound whether from the baby or something else . In addition, IMU attachments allow additional alerts from the target with classified gestures to understand the behavior of the childâ€™s needs. All of these features are integrated into a product at a low cost with real time and secure performance. With a stable and non-dominated market, the NightLight infant monitor has lots of room to establish a strong consumer base.

## Objectives/Fulfillments: 
- Real time pose tracking daytime nighttime by OpenCv
- Functional feedback after event detected in vision by camera or gesture by IMU
- Real time execution of commands
- Robust one to many server-multiclient functionality
- "Alexa-like", hands free voice commands
- Intuitive, infomational, and secure UI with encrypted login system

## System Description:
Note: Subject to change as project is implemented
### Sensors
**Hardware**
- Night vision camera and regular camera modes (Ideally integrated into one)
- Laptop/Screen
- Phone for external command interface
- Speaker and Microphone (separate)
- IMU on RPi
**Software**
- Python Speech Library (Speech Recognition)
- Python with OpenCV

### Flip Detection
- Accelerometer, gyroscope (6DOF) for IMU orientation and general movement
- IMU measures motion and ports data to central processing, which compares with robust gesture classifiers to a certain tolerance.

### Image Processing
- Use opencv for gathering video data then send to the host.
- Implementation Note: image processing is done in the host machine.

### Graphics/Display
- Streaming video option (Initiate video TCP client)
- Streaming audio option (Initiate adio TCP client)
- Play Lullaby option
- Chat with other remote users option

### Commands/Feedback
- Text or Voice based commands to the laptop (TCP)
- Recording option
- Alerts option
- Classification of targets

### Secure Login
- SQL Local database updates AWS server with encrypted user account info
